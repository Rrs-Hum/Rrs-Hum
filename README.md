### ðŸ”¹ Network Traffic Analysis with tcpdump & Wireshark â€“ Completed
Conducted packet capture and analysis as part of the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**.  
**Key Tasks:**
- Captured network traffic with **tcpdump** using targeted filters (host/port/protocol) and saved rotating PCAP files.
- Analyzed PCAPs in **Wireshark** to inspect TCP/UDP flows, **HTTP/DNS** transactions, and baseline vs. anomalous activity.
- Applied display filters and *Follow TCP Stream* to trace sessions and extract **IOCs** (IPs, domains, URIs).
- Documented findings and recommended monitoring/containment steps.

**Skills:** tcpdump, Wireshark, packet analysis, IOC extraction, report writing.
